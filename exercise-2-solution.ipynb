    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the conditions that revealing a field doesn't lead to linkability?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If many holders share the same value of the field, the verifier will not be able\n",
    "> to link the proofs to a specific holder.\n",
    "> One can think of it like \"k-anonymity\", where \"k\" is the number of holders with the\n",
    "> identical value for the field.\n",
    "> Once the holder reveals more than one field, the \"k\" drops very rapidly to 1,\n",
    "> which means that the holder can be linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How can the verifier be sure that the proof is not stale, meaning that it is not a replayed proof?\n",
    "\n",
    "> For this to work, one can do either of:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. Define the protocol to include a timestamp of the proof\n",
    "> 2. Have the verifier send a random challenge to the holder, and then\n",
    ">    verify whether the challenge has been incorporated in the proof\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For both possibilities, the\n",
    "> [IETF-draft on BBS+](https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html#name-header-and-presentation-hea)\n",
    "> proposes for the holder to use the attribute `presentation_header` to\n",
    "> attach a proof of freshness to the proof sent to the verifier.\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can you easily implement this? Unfortunately the docknetwork/crypto-library doesn't have a good API documentation.\n",
    "   Look at the [PresentationBuilder](https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/c32072b85150b6c1febadb29d2b8b7f4dbe7e40b/src/anonymous-credentials/presentation-builder.ts#L120). Which field looks like the best to use for the purpose of avoiding replays?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unfortunately the library doesn't follow the namings of the IETF draft standard.\n",
    "> But looking at the fields, two stand out:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> // This can specify the reason why the proof was created, or date of the proof, or self-attested attributes (as JSON string), etc\n",
    ">  _context?: string;\n",
    ">  // To prevent replay attack\n",
    ">  _nonce?: Uint8Array;\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> So the `context` must correspond to the `header` in the IETF-draft, and as such\n",
    "> should be set by the issuer.\n",
    "> The `nonce` must then be the `presentation_header`, which can be used for a challenge\n",
    "> or a timestamp.\n"
