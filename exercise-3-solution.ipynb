    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What security did we imply with this setup?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The issuer has to be trusted: with the private key, the issuer can\n",
    "> prove any value to be included or excluded in the accumulator!\n",
    "> In case of revocation, the security is only that the issuer will not send an\n",
    "> updated `witness` to the holder.\n",
    "> Which means that the holder will only be able to prove that they were not \n",
    "> revoked in a previous accumulator.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. What can go wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The holder could use a stale accumulator proof when proving the statement.\n",
    "> - As the issuer needs to send out updates of the accumulator to all holders,\n",
    ">   this is usually only done on a periodic time base.\n",
    ">   Between two updates, a holder might have a revoked credential which is still\n",
    ">   valid until the next update.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How can the verifier be sure that it didn't get a stale proof of the accumulator?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Like for any other of the proofs, the verifier can require the inclusion of a\n",
    "> challenge by the prover.\n",
    "> It can require this to be done directly in the `nonMemWitness` proof, or in\n",
    "> the `nonce` as seen previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How can the verifier be sure that the proof hasn't been done on a stale accumulator?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As the accumulator is part of the computation whether the `statement x` is correct\n",
    "> for a given `proof p`, the verifier can check whether the accumulator sent by the\n",
    "> holder is the latest one or not."
