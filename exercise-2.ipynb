    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore the BBS cryptographic scheme, and see how it differs from a classic RSA scheme as explored in the previous exercise.\n",

    "For this, we will use the [docknetwork crypto library](https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto). \n",

    "Dock.io have listed 16 employess published on their website and are originated in Switzerland, but are now USA based.\n",
